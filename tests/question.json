    "question": "What is Arthroscopic lavage and cartilage debridement?",
    "answer": "Arthroscopic lavage and cartilage debridement are operative treatments for osteoarthritis (OA). Lavage is a procedure in which intra-articular fluid is aspirated and the joint is washed out, removing inflammatory mediators, debris, or small loose bodies from the osteoarthritic knee. Articular debridement involves removal of cartilage or meniscal fragments but also can include cartilage abrasion, excision of osteophytes, and synovectomy. Debridement is intended to improve symptoms and joint function in patients with mechanical symptoms such as locking or catching of the knee."

    "question": "What are the procedure that are not consider reasonable in treatment of the osteoarthritic knee and are not covered by the Medicare program?",
    "answer": "1. Arthroscopic lavage used alone for the osteoarthritic knee.\n2. Arthroscopic debridement for osteoarthritic patients presenting with knee pain only.\n3. Arthroscopic debridement and lavage with or without debridement for patients presenting with severe osteoarthritis (Severe osteoarthritis is defined in the Outerbridge classification scale, grades III and IV. Outerbridge is the most commonly used clinical scale that classifies the severity of joint degeneration of the knee by compartments and grades. Grade I is defined as softening or blistering of joint cartilage. Grade II is defined as fragmentation or fissuring in an area <1 cm. Grade III presents clinically with cartilage fragmentation or fissuring in an area >1 cm. Grade IV refers to cartilage erosion down to the bone. Grades III and IV are characteristic of severe osteoarthritis.)"

    "question": "How to treat Cervical Degenerative Disc Disease?",
    "answer": "Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion has historically been considered the definitive surgical treatment for symptomatic degenerative disc disease of the cervical spine. The goals of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion are to relieve pressure on the spinal nerves (decompression) and to restore spinal column alignment and stability. Resolution of pain and neurologic symptoms may be expected in 80% to 100% of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion patients. Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion involves an anterolateral surgical approach, decompression of the affected spinal level, discectomy, and placement of a PEEK (polyetheretherketone) or titanium interbody cage plus autograft or allograft bone in the prepared intervertebral space to stimulate healing and eventual fusion between the vertebral endplates. A metal anterior cervical plate is attached to the adjoining vertebral bodies to stabilize the fusion site, maintain neck lordosis, and reduce the need for prolonged postoperative brace application that is needed following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion without an anterior plate. Although there may be slight differences between autograft and allograft sources in the postoperative rate of union, clinical studies have demonstrated similar rates of postoperative fusion (90% to 100%) and satisfactory outcomes using either bone source. Studies have suggested that altered adjacent-segment kinematics following fusion may lead to adjacent-level degenerative disc disease and the need for secondary surgery.\n\nCervical disc arthroplasty is proposed as an alternative to anterior cervical discectomy and fusion for patients with symptomatic cervical degenerative disc disease. In cervical disc arthroplasty, an artificial disc device is secured in the prepared intervertebral space rather than an interbody cage and/or bone. An anterior plate is not used to stabilize the adjacent vertebrae, and postsurgical external orthosis is usually not required. The cervical disc arthroplasty was designed to maintain anatomic disc space height, normal segmental lordosis, and physiological motion patterns at the index and adjacent cervical levels. The potential to reduce the risk of adjacent-level degenerative disc disease above or below a fusion site has been the major reason driving device development and use. Disc arthroplasty and anterior cervical discectomy and fusion have very similar surgical indications, primarily unremitting pain due to radiculopathy or myelopathy, weakness in the extremities, or paresthesia. However, the chief complaint in cervical disc arthroplasty candidates should be radicular or myelopathic symptoms in the absence of significant spondylosis or spondylolisthesis."

    "question": "Define the term Axial Lumbosacral Interbody Fusion",
    "answer": "Axial lumbosacral interbody fusion (also called presacral, transsacral, or paracoccygeal interbody fusion) is a minimally invasive technique designed to provide anterior access to the L4-S1 disc spaces for interbody fusion while minimizing damage to muscular, ligamentous, neural, and vascular structures. It is performed under fluoroscopic guidance. An advantage of axial lumbosacral interbody fusion is that it preserves the annulus and all paraspinous soft tissue structures. However, there is an increased need for fluoroscopy and an inability to address intracanal pathology or visualize the discectomy procedure directly. Complications of the axial approach may include perforation of the bowel and injury to blood vessels and/or nerves."

    "question": "What is Regulatory Status of Facet Arthroplasty?",
    "answer": "In June 2023, the Total Posterior Spine (TOPS™; Premia Spine) System was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) via the premarket approval (PMA) process (PMA: P220002). Per the approval order statement, 'the TOPS System is a motion-preserving spinal implant that is inserted into the lumbar spine via pedicle screws. The only FDA\u2011regulated activity noted is a multicenter investigational device exemption (IDE) trial of the Total Facet Arthroplasty System that was discontinued for financial reasons, and a phase\u20113 randomized trial of the ACADIA Facet Replacement System that has completed enrollment but whose results have not yet been fully published. FDA Product Code: QWK. Other products are currently under review. The ACADIA® Facet Replacement System (Facet Solutions, acquired by Globus Medical in 2011) was being evaluated in a FDA regulated investigational device exemption phase 3 trial, which was completed in October 2017; results without statistical analysis were posted on ClinicalTrials.gov but have not been published in the peer-reviewed literature. ACADIA Facet Replacement System is currently only available outside of the U.S."

    "question": "Give background of Hip Resurfacing.",
    "answer": "Total Hip Resurfacing: Hip resurfacing is an alternative to total hip arthroplasty (THA; also known as total hip replacement) for patients with advanced arthritis of the hip. Total hip resurfacing describes the placement of a shell that covers the femoral head together with implantation of an acetabular cup. Partial hip resurfacing is considered a treatment option for avascular necrosis with collapse of the femoral head. Total hip resurfacing has been investigated in patients with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and advanced avascular necrosis as an alternative to THA, particularly in young active patients who would potentially outlive a total hip prosthesis. Therefore, hip resurfacing could be viewed as a time-buying procedure to delay the need for a THA. Proposed advantages of total hip resurfacing compared with THA include preservation of the femoral neck and femoral canal, thus facilitating revision or conversion to total hip resurfacing, if required. In addition, the resurfaced head is more similar in size to the normal femoral head, thus increasing the stability and decreasing the risk of dislocation compared with THA. Total hip resurfacing has undergone various evolutions, with modifications in prosthetic design and composition and implantation techniques. \n- Preservation of the femoral neck and canal, which facilitates future revision or conversion to THA.  \n- A resurfaced head that is closer in size to the natural femoral head, increasing joint stability and reducing the risk of dislocation compared with THA.  \n\nThe design of hip resurfacing implants has evolved over time. Early devices used polyethylene acetabular components, but wear\u2011particle\u2013induced osteolysis led to the development of metal\u2011on\u2011metal acetabular components to improve longevity.  \n\nRegulatory approval milestones:  \n- In 2006, the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing System (Smith &\u202fNephew Orthopaedics) received FDA pre\u2011market approval based on a series of 2,203 patients (2,385 hips) operated on by a single surgeon in England, with post\u2011approval studies required for long\u2011term safety and effectiveness. and the longer-term safety and effectiveness of the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing system in the United States by studying 350 patients at up to 8 sites where clinical and radiographic data will be assessed annually through 5 years and at 10 years; also, determine cobalt and chromium serum concentration and renal function in these patients at 1, 4, and 10 years; implement a training program to provide clinical updates to investigators. Two additional metal-on-metal hip resurfacing systems have been approved: in 2007, the"
